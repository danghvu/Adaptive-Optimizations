===-- README - test-suite --------------------------------------------------===

 This file describes the files contained in this directory regarding running
 the LLVM test-suite with our JIT framework.

===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===

===-- Overview -------------------------------------------------------------===

 In order to run the LLVM test-suite with our JIT framework and lli, copy
 the files 'TEST.nightly.Makefile' and 'Makefile.programs' to the build
 directory of the test-suite (i.e. llvm-build/projects/test-suite/).  In order
 to run the test, simply run the following command:

  make -j 8 TEST=nightly EXTRA_LLIFLAGS="-enable-online-profile -t1 X -t2 Y"

 where X and Y represent the desired T1 and T2 thresholds, respectively.  The
 output will present native time, jit-origin (lli) time, and jit (ours) time.

 Further, the 'run.py' file is provided as a convenience for running the
 test-suite many times for different T1 and T2 values.  To use the script,
 move 'run.py' to the build directory of the test-suite (i.e. llvm-build/
 projects/test-suite/), create a 'results' directory in the test-suite (i.e.
 llvm-build/projects/test-suite/results/), and change the start, end, and step
 values for T1 and T2 in the script to produce the desired tests.  Once these
 steps are complete, simply run the script by typing './run.py'.

 Note that the only tests in the LLVM test-suite that our framework fails on
 are tests that lli fail as well.  Further, any memory leaks that show up
 when using valgrind have been due to features in LLVM that our framework
 uses; none of them are a result of what we have directly written.
