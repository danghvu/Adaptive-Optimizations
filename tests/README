     Adding Tests
----------------------
To add a test, if the test is written in c, simply place the
test in the 'source' directory.  Once this is done, run 'make'
to create the LLVM IR code associated with the test, placed in
the 'llvm-ll' directory.

----------------------
   Running  Tests
----------------------
In order to run a test with the developed online profile-
guided JIT optimization framework, simply run the following
command:

lli -enable-online-profile FILE.ll

----------------------
    Other Comments
----------------------
Currently, the only tests that are added which will run the
profiling 'pass' are the following:

thresh1.c
thresh2.c

Further, running 'make clean' will delete only LLVM IR files
which have associated (c) source files
