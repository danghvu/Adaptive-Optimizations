===-- README - tests -------------------------------------------------------===

 This file describes the layout of this directory and how to add tests

===-------------------------------------------------------------------------===

===-- Overview -------------------------------------------------------------===

 This directory contains the sub-directories which contain the tests for our
 JIT framework.  The 'profile' directory contains tests specific to the
 profiling aspects of the framework.  The 'inliner' directory contains tests
 specific to the dynamic inliner pass.  The 'medium' directory contains
 medium-sized tests.  The 'large' directory contains large-sized tests

 To add a test, simply place the .c or .cpp file in the 'source' directory
 of one of the sub-directories mentioned above.  Currently the Makefiles
 in each sub-directory only support single-source programs.  Further, if the
 .c or ,cpp file is unavailable, it is sufficient to put the .ll file in the
 'llvm-ll' directory of one of the sub-directories mentioned above.
